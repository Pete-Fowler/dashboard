This layout was achieved from scratch to match an image of a site. It made use of nested grids and flex boxes within an overall grid for page layout. This was an excellent exercise to explore the best use cases of flex boxes and grids and combinations of the two.

I learned to properly align the main grid section by using height: calc() to make the height of the wrapper boxes 100% minus the size of their h2 labels, and also making one of the grid rows .85fr. This section was made responsive with columns using repeat, auto-fit, and minmax. 

The right bar seemed like it may be better suited to flex boxes, but the exercise was to use grid as much as possible.  The value of the exercise showed itself here since I had to use some more specific controls and gain more proficiency with grid rather than making a bunch of flex boxes and hoping for the best.
